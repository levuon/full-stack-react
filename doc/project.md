# babel

we need a Bable/register in order to get better coverage of the ECMAScript 2015 and 2016 specification, the will enable us to support such structures as `async` and `generator` functions

```
babel@6.5.2 babel-core@6.6.5  babel-polyfill@6.6.1 babel-loader@6.2.4
babel-preset-es2015@6.6.0 babel-preset-react@6.5.0 babel-preset-stage-0@6.5.0

```

1. bable-preset-stage-0 is for ES7 features.
2. babel-preset-es2015 and babel-preset-react are required for JSX and ES6 support


- babel and babel-core/register: the library is transpiling new ECMAScript functions into exiting version.
- cors: the module is responsible for creating cross-origin requests to our domain in an easy way.
- body-parser: this is the middleware for parsing the request's body.
